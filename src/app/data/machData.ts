What is more, it is available to on-line real time workload inertia check and adjustment of gain at any time to achieve the best control effect. BCSD series servo drive is able to match 17 bits serial absolute encoder which in turn enhances position precision and low speed stability & response performance. Simple & Convenient Setting BCSD series servo drive completely pursues the simplicity of utilization to automatically determine mechanical characteristic and set needed servo gain. Besides, it achieves “on-line automatically adjustment functions”. Automatic adjustment of servo system to meet mechanical characteristic enables less debugging time and simpler operation. Even for the first time to use it, it can finish the best optimized setting in a short time. Abundant Communication Functions BCSD series servo drive provide RS485 and CAN communication interface. It can communicate with WinBCSD software runing on PC by serial cable(RS485 convert to RS232), and communicate with FAGOR CNC by CAN bus.",
